This is the story of a girl who cried the whole world, and while she looked so good in photographs, I absolutely loved it when she smiled
Man, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well, I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My mu√±equita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove
Ladies and gentleman it's Mambo number 5.
One, Two, Three, Four, Five 
Baby Shark duh duh duh duh Baby Shark Duh Duh Duh
Janies got a gun, Janies got a gun
what did her daddy do
something something something
